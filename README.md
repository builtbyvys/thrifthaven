# Thrifthaven

Thrifthaven is a passion project, made for my school's summer bridge this year.
I am planning to integrate this into the thrift store to implement online
checkout and a rewards system coming soon.

I'm also making this open-sourced to allow future developers to learn from this,
and to show proof of work on my portfolio. I hope this can help aspiring future developers,
and to make them aim for something better than this. This was made using NextJS,
Swell, and Clerk.

## ⚠ WARNING ⚠

[Swell](https://swell.is) is actually paid, but has a 14 day trial. There may be
better alternatives as time goes on. If there is, go ahead and use this to try
to implement such alternative. Although, [Clerk](https://clerk.com) is a good
signup/signin dashboard that's freemium.

## Deployment

Make sure to run the following commands to deploy:

```
npm install
npm run (dev, build, start, lint)
```
